// 1. bring AWS or connect all the services of your server to AWS 
2. polling to clipboard.
3. polling to server.
4. authentication middleware --> bring to browser. 

Part 3.

Three http methods required:
GET 
POST 
DELETE 

GET/file  - polling to server
          - response will return URL.
          - in my script I have to download the file from the URL.
          - than I have to read the content and paste it to clipboard

POST/file - polling to clipboard 
           - in python
           - content changes 
           - put that content into file names text.txt --- this is the point where 
             we must know how to write in a file in -- Python
           - in response of POST/file we get pre-signed url for uploading file 
           - post to AWS through pre-signed URL 
           
        PN   - we will hit the POST-file/ only when the clipboard content changes.

[DELETE file/ -- EXPIRY concern will be taken care by AWS S3 functionality - 5 mintues]

[TODO]
1. How to get presigned url from s3 in nodejs? --- done

2. How to read a file in python and writing to file?  --- going to do 

3. Which HTTP method to be used for uplaoding/downloading a file from/to url in python? --- resolved 
   PUT for upload & GET for download.

4. What things are required to GET and POST for generating pre-signed urls ? --- Not getting ???


*********Pending************

5. Middleware fix - to be accessed from browser also.

6. Differentiate between copy and paste action - 
          so that we know when we need to upload the content of clipboard to S3.

7. Read how the python is downloading the file from the URL.
