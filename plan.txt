1. polling to clipboard - 
2. polling to server   - paste the response to the clipboard using python
3. bring AWS or connect all the services of your server to AWS 
4. middleware - bring to browser 

Part 3.

Three http methods required:
GET 
POST 
DELETE 

GET file/  - polling to server
           - response will return URL 
           - in my script I have to download  the file 
           - than I have to read the content and paste it to clipboard
           - clipboard - polling to server

POST file/ - polling to clipboard 
           - python 
           - content changes 
           - put that content into file names text.txt
           - in response of /POST file we get pre-signed url for uploading file 
           - post to AWS through pre-signed URL 

DELETE file/

EXPIRY concern will be taken care by AWS S3 functionality - 5 mintues

[TODO]
1. How to get presigned url from s3 in nodejs?
2. How to read a file in python and wiritng to file?
3. Which HTTP method to be used for uplaoding/downloading a file from/to url in python?
4. What things are required to GET and POST for generating pre-signed urls ?
5. Middleware fix - to be accessed from browser also.
