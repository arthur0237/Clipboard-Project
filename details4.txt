***Implementing --> the flow of clipboard content between server-AWS and user's clipboard. And implementing the end points for uploading , downloading and deleting on AWS-S3.

What will be the flow ??

Flow of data from clipboard to the server and call to the endpoints will be dependent on what shortcut keys user is pressing. 

If user hits Ctrl+C - the content copied to the clipboard will be posted on AWS-s3 via endpoint /post-content.

If user hits Ctrl+V - the content on the AWS-s3 will be pasted to the user's clipboard via endpoint /get-content.
   Doubt ---> delay ??

The last thing is that with each data an expiry time should be associated with it. We don't want to hold the data unnecessarily over AWS-s3 for an extended time period. User will be notified that for how long the data will be available to him/her for fetching. ----->> expiry will be implemented via endpoint /delete-content.
